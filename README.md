# Prediction of Student Admission to Graduate Programs
This is a student project and It's about University ranking analysis. For this project we are using Graduate Admission Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv) We will use machine learning to analyze the data, find a model to predict the University Ranking and then visualise the result.
